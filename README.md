# MKR_Registeration_Data_Analysis
## Summary :
For this data analysis task, we were provided with seven datasets from different masterclasses—Excel, Canva, Digital Marketing, Podcast, Public Speaking, Video Editing, and WhatsApp Marketing—conducted by MKR. Our objective was to clean, analyze, and visualize these datasets to uncover meaningful insights.

Before visualizing the data in Tableau, it was essential to clean it. I used Python for the data cleaning process. First, I cleaned each of the seven datasets individually. Then, I merged them into a single consolidated dataset. I also created several additional columns based on the existing data to help derive deeper insights. Finally, I exported the cleaned and enriched dataset to an Excel file, which I later used for creating visualizations in Tableau.

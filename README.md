<h2>📊 MKR Registration Data Analysis</h2>

<h3>📌 Project Summary</h3>
<p>
For this data analysis task, we were provided with seven datasets from different masterclasses—<b>Excel</b>, <b>Canva</b>, <b>Digital Marketing</b>, <b>Podcast</b>, <b>Public Speaking</b>, <b>Video Editing</b>, and <b>WhatsApp Marketing</b>—conducted by MKR. Our objective was to clean, analyze, and visualize these datasets to uncover meaningful insights.
</p>

<p>
Before visualizing the data in Tableau, it was essential to clean it. I used <b>Python</b> for the data cleaning process. First, I cleaned each of the seven datasets individually. Then, I merged them into a single consolidated dataset. I also created several additional columns based on the existing data to help derive deeper insights. Finally, I exported the cleaned and enriched dataset to an Excel file, which I later used for creating visualizations in Tableau.

<h3>🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cleaned and preprocessed seven datasets from different MKR masterclasses using <b>Python</b> (<b>Excel</b>, <b>Canva</b>, <b>Digital Marketing</b>, <b>Podcast</b>, <b>Public Speaking</b>, <b>Video Editing</b>, and <b>WhatsApp Marketing</b>).</li>
  <li>Merged individual datasets into a consolidated dataset, creating new columns to enable richer analysis and deeper insights.</li>
</ul>

<h3>📊 Data Visualization</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Exported the enriched dataset to <b>Excel</b> and built interactive <b>Tableau</b> dashboards to visualize patterns and participant engagement.</li>
  <li>Analyzed the masterclasses' data to uncover trends and insights, helping understand attendance and registration behaviors.</li>

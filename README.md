# MKR_Registeration_Data_Analysis
## Summary :
For This Data Analysis Task. We Were Provided With 7 Datasets Of Different Masterclasses(Excel, Canva, Digital Marketing, Podcast, Public Speaking, Video Editing, Whatsapp Marketing) Conducted By MKR And Our Task is To Clean, Analyze and Visualize These Datsets To Find Useful Insights.So, Before Visualizng This Dataset On Tableau It Needs To Be cleaned First. I use Python For Cleaning The Datasets. First I cleaned These 7 Datasets Separately And Then Join/Merge These 7 Datasets Into One and Finally I Have Created Some Additional Cloumns Based On The Given Data That Can Help In Deriving Useful Insights From These Datasets and Then Export The Final Cleaned Dataset into an Excel File Which I later Use To Visualize This Dataset On Tableau.
